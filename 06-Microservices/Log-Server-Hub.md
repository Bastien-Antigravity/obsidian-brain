## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR-001: Liveness over Completeness (Gap Timeout)
*   **Context**: Out-of-order delivery via TCP/UDP can cause sequence gaps in the BTreeMap buffer.
*   **Decision**: Enforce a **500ms timeout** on missing sequences. If the missing sequence doesn't arrive within this window, the server forces progress to the next available sequence.
*   **Rationale**: Service availability is prioritized over perfect sequential integrity. A blocked writer stops the entire fleet from logging (back-pressure).
*   **Consequence**: Small gaps in logs are possible under high packet loss, but service uptime is guaranteed.
