# TODO: obsidian-brain (Governance & Meta-Logic)

## 🚨 High Priority (Governance Gaps)
- [ ] **Mode Guardrail**: Add a mandatory "Current Mode" check to the AI-Session-State handshake to ensure the previous mode is "parked."
- [ ] **Knowledge Compression Script**: Implement an automated way to distill old session logs into fresh patterns to keep the context window clean.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Refactoring
- [ ] Consolidate common BDD templates into a centralized `00-Master-Templates` folder.

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Initial structure for `02-Business-BDD`. (Now `business-bdd-brain`)
- [x] Creation of `03-Tech-Stack/06-Role-Wisdom/`. (Now in `tech-stack-brain`)
- [x] Multi-Mode Switching Framework via `MODE-MANUAL.md` and `start_squad.py`.
- [x] Fleet Operations Brain (`fleet-operation-brain`) for fleet-wide action logs.
- [x] Labs Brain (`rapid-prototyping-brain`) for experimental/rapid-proto work.
- [x] Updated `Daily-AI-Playbook.md` with mode-specific "Rules of Engagement."
- [x] Python Ecosystem Standardization (18 scripts, headers, aliasing, docstrings).
- [x] Submodule URL correction (`.gitmodules` → new repo names).
- [x] Integrated Preflight Check system (`Preflight-Check.py`).
- [x] Standardized Business Data Models (MarketEvent, OHLCV, Signal) and migrated business services.
