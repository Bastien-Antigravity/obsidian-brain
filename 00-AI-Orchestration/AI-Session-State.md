# 🧠 AI Session State: Command Center

> [!IMPORTANT] ASYNCHRONOUS DOCUMENTATION
> Update associated documentation (**README.md**, **ARCHITECTURE.md**) and relevant **Obsidian Brain** nodes ONLY upon feature completion or sprint closure.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Market-Observer Version Update (2026-06-18)
- **Role**: Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: MO-VERSION-UPDATE-2026-06-18
- **Actions**:
    - Updated `market-observer/VERSION.txt` from `1.3.0` to `0.0.1`.
    - Synchronized `market-observer/AI-Session-State.md` to reflect the new version `0.0.1`.
    - Verified `market-observer/README.md` and `market-observer/AI-Project-DNA.md` for hardcoded version references (none found).
- **Deliverables**:
    - `market-observer` project version set to `0.0.1`.
    - Consistency across version tracking documents.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Bot Asset Resolution Fix (2026-06-14)
- **Role**: Lead Developer / Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: TELE-REMOTE-ASSET-FIX-2026-06-14
- **Actions**:
    - **Robust Asset Discovery**: Implemented absolute path resolution for `AssetDir`. The bot now searches for its assets in multiple candidate locations (workspace root, repo root, etc.) and converts the result to an absolute path.
    - **Safe File Access**: Updated the `/start` handler to verify file existence via `os.Stat` before attempting to send a photo. This provides clear error logging instead of a runtime library crash.
    - **Verified Absolute Paths**: Confirmed that `AssetDir` is logged during startup to ensure correct anchoring.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `tele-remote` now correctly loads `start.png` regardless of the starting directory.
    - Improved diagnostic logging for missing assets.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Secret Decryption Integration (2026-06-13)
- **Role**: Lead Developer / Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: CONFIG-SECRET-INTEGRATION-2026-06-13
- **Actions**:
    - **Automated Decryption**: Integrated the `secret` package into the core configuration `loader`. The ecosystem now automatically decrypts any `ENC(...)` blocks found in YAML files or environment variables during the loading phase.
    - **Base64/RSA Support**: Verified support for RSA-2048 encrypted blobs in YAML.
    - **Type Consistency**: Refactored the YAML processor to force all non-boolean values to strings. This resolves a recurring issue where numeric ports or IDs caused unmarshaling failures in services like `tele-remote`.
    - **Test Alignment**: Updated `distributed-config` tests to pass with the new "String-First" philosophy.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Transparent secret management across the fleet.
    - Robust configuration loading with automatic type coercion.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Tele-Remote Crash Fix (2026-06-13)
- **Role**: Lead Developer / Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: TELE-REMOTE-CRASH-2026-06-13
- **Actions**:
    - **Fixed Silent Crash**: Program now prints synchronous error messages when initialization fails, preventing error loss during hard exits.
    - **Config Type Parity**: Resolved a critical unmarshaling error in `GetCapability` where `port` and `chat_id` type mismatches (string vs int) caused the entire Telegram config to fail to load.
    - **Asset Path Robustness**: Updated `AssetDir` detection to support running from both repo root and workspace root, fixing the "start.png" load failure.
    - **Enhanced Resilience**: Updated `distributed-config` to automatically stringify `chat_id` and `telegram_id` for ecosystem compatibility.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Functional `tele-remote` with clear error diagnostics.
    - More resilient `distributed-config` library.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Config Sync Hardening & Full Refresh (2026-06-13)
- **Role**: Lead Developer / Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: CONFIG-SYNC-REFRESH-2026-06-13
- **Actions**:
    - **Delta Sync Bugfix (CRITICAL)**: Identified and fixed a bug in `distributed-config` where `BROADCAST_SYNC` (delta updates) would overwrite the entire local configuration. Implemented proper merging using `parentConfig.Set()`.
    - **Full Refresh (FEAT-003)**: Added a dedicated `FULL_REFRESH` command to the `ConfigMsg` Protobuf schema.
    - **Server-Side Support**: Updated `config-server` request handler to process `FULL_REFRESH` requests by returning the full configuration map.
    - **Client-Side Support**: Added `FullRefresh()` method to the `distributed-config` client.
    - **Verified Mathematical Integrity**: Created `bug_repro_test.go` and verified that deltas merge correctly while full syncs (`GET_SYNC`, `FULL_REFRESH`) replace the state.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Hardened `distributed-config` sync logic (Merge vs Replace).
    - New `FULL_REFRESH` protocol capability.
    - Validated synchronization behavior via regression tests.

## 📡 Gemini CLI Session: Config Server Hardening (2026-06-13)
- **Role**: Lead Developer / Orchestrator | Mode: 1 (Execution)
- **Status**: COMPLETED | Mission-ID: CONFIG-HARDENING-2026-06-13
- **Actions**:
    - **Atomic Persistence (FEAT-004)**: Refactored `PersistenceManager.Save` to use `os.CreateTemp`, `Sync()`, and `os.Rename` for true crash-safety. Verified with `persistence_test.go`.
    - **Ghost Listener Cleanup (FEAT-003)**: Hardened the connection handler to explicitly call `removeListener` if a socket write fails, preventing zombie listeners in the broadcast pool.
    - **Shadow Port Protocol**: Implemented the `Base Port + 1` fallback logic for gRPC addresses in the `distributed-config` library. Verified with `config_test.go`.
    - **Quality Assurance**: Created unit tests for persistence and address resolution, ensuring 100% pass rate for new logic.
- **Deliverables**:
    - Hardened `config-server` persistence and connection management.
    - Standardized Shadow Port resolution across the ecosystem.
    - New test coverage for core configuration logic.
