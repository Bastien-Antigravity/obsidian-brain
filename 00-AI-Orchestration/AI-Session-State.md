# 🧠 AI Session State: obsidian-brain

> [!IMPORTANT] ASYNCHRONOUS DOCUMENTATION
> Update associated documentation (**README.md**, **ARCHITECTURE.md**) and relevant **Obsidian Brain** nodes ONLY upon feature completion or sprint closure to preserve compute and prevent task drift. Do NOT update documentation after every minor code modification.

## 🚀 Progress Tracking

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Fleet-Documentation-Taxonomy-Normalization | Trace-ID: 2026-05-16
- [x] **Taxonomy Normalization**: Implemented transversal tag families (`#service/`, `#tech/`, `#tier/`, `#zone/`) across the fleet. Updated `tag_taxonomy.md` and `AI-Project-DNA.md`.
- [x] **Isolation Protocol**: Deployed `#ai/ignore` tags and scaffolded `quick-overview/` directories in core repos to isolate human documentation.
- [x] **Sentinel Upgrades**: Hardened the Sovereignty engine with auto-fixing for metadata and orphan tag detection (filtering hex codes).
- [x] **Governance Hardening**: Updated `CODEOWNERS` for robust protection and synchronized master `AI-Init.md` with modern rules and fixed paths.
- [x] **Hygiene Resolution**: Remedied 39+ metadata violations across the vault. (COMPLETED 2026-05-16)

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: FleetCommander-Unification | Trace-ID: 2026-05-15
- [x] **Script Unification**: Merged `repo-commander.py` logic into `fleet-commander.py`, adding single-repo targeting (`--repo`) and integrating strict compliance audits (Docs, Architecture, Quick-Overview).
- [x] **Prompt Consolidation**: Updated `Prompt-FleetCommander.md` to handle both fleet-wide and single-repo compliance check-ins.
- [x] **Deprecation**: Removed `repo-commander.py` and `Prompt-RepoCommander.md` to streamline the squad.
- [x] **Finalization**: The unified FleetCommander role is active and ready to enforce standards. (COMPLETED 2026-05-15)

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Distributed-Config-Hardening | Trace-ID: 2026-05-14
- [x] **Sentinel Protocol**: Audited `distributed-config` for race conditions and implemented `RWMutex` fixes in CGO bridge. Verified handle safety lifecycle.
- [x] **DocMaintainer Protocol**: Graduated `FEAT-008` (Resilience) and `FEAT-012` (Handle Safety) to `active` in Business BDD. Updated implementation links.
- [x] **Finalization**: Executed cross-language FFI validation (Python/Rust), stress tests, and network resilience mock tests. (COMPLETED 2026-05-14)

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Fleet-Operation-Health-Audit | Trace-ID: 2026-05-13
- [x] **Sentinel Protocol**: Analyzed `2026-05-12-Fleet-Sync.md` and verified zero drift with `2026-05-11-Standardize-GitHub-CI.md`.
- [x] **DocMaintainer Protocol**: Verified MOC links and marked `2026-05-11-Standardize-GitHub-CI.md` as `status: completed`.
- [x] **Finalization**: Executed `close_mission.py` to finalize fleet synchronization state. (COMPLETED 2026-05-13)

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: GolangCI-Lint-Migration | Trace-ID: 2026-05-12
- [x] **V2 Stabilization**: Finalized `golangci-lint` v2 migration and resolved core compilation errors.
- [x] **Stabilization**: Corrected invalid `v2.12.2` to `v1.64.2` in `workflow-go.yml` and `master-ci.yml`.

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Hygiene-Resolution | Trace-ID: 2026-05-12
- [x] **Integrity Resolution**: Resolved 22 warnings and fixed 12 critical violations.

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Brain-Sentinel-Remediation | Trace-ID: 2026-05-13
- [x] **Audit Remediation**: Resolved Preflight and Brain Sentinel violations (Mode mismatch, Mission-ID format, and YAML/Taxonomy drift). (COMPLETED 2026-05-13)

## 🛰️ Mission-ID: Vault-Hardening-Sync | Trace-ID: 2026-05-12
- [x] **Ontime-Scheduler Integration**: Registered repo, pushed to GitHub (Go), and created Hub documentation. (COMPLETED 2026-05-12)
- [x] **Link Remediation**: Repaired 37 broken links in 06-Microservices and Hubs. (COMPLETED 2026-05-12)
- [x] **Knowledge Compression**: Script rewritten to ecosystem standards and successfully archived old states. (COMPLETED 2026-05-12)
- [x] **Sovereignty Audit**: Resolved frontmatter violations in core governance and scheduler files. (COMPLETED 2026-05-12)

- [x] **Python Ecosystem Standardization**: All 18 scripts hardened for cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux). (COMPLETED 2026-05-07)
    - Headers, Import Aliasing, Visual Formatting, Docstrings applied per `04-Python-Types-and-Structure.md`.
    - UTF-8 terminal encoding fixed for Windows.
- [x] **Brain Infrastructure Fix**: Submodule URLs updated, Preflight system added. (COMPLETED 2026-05-07)
    - `.gitmodules` corrected to new repo names.
    - `Preflight-Check.py` created for automatic drift detection.
    - `inventory.json` made portable with relative paths.
- [/] **FEAT-002: Orderbook Persistence**: Design phase complete. Implementation next.
    - BDD Spec drafted with `orderbook_aggregator` schema rule.
    - SQL Migration (Hypertable + JSONB) generated in `orderbook-aggregator/sql/`.
    - Next: Add database worker logic to `data-ingestor`.

## 🐛 Local Issues / Bugs
- **Log/Notif/Config Servers**: Known issues in state but prioritized lower than Value Stream (FEAT-001).
- **QA Stabilization**: Fixed package naming conflicts in Sandbox (`scenarios` vs `go`).

## 🔭 Strategic Oracle (Chronos-Oracle)
- **Pulse (2026-05-07)**: Infrastructure hardening phase is **COMPLETE**. All brains standardized. Preflight system prevents future drift.
- **Strategic Pattern**: "Unified State" is now the law for cross-exchange analysis.
- **Instruction**: Ensure `data-ingestor` remains stateless regarding market logic; it only handles raw ingest and persistence batches.
