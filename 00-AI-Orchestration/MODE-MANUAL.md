# 🕹️ AI Operating Manual: Multi-Mode Protocols

This document defines the "Rules of Engagement" for the Antigravity AI assistant. By switching
between these modes, the USER can balance between **Safety (Specs)**, **Speed (Labs)**, and
**Scale (Orchestrator)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing the mode changes the **Workflow**, not the **Brain**. All knowledge remains shared
> across all modes. The `active_mode` field in the header governs which protocol is active.

## 🛡️ Mode 1: Spec-First (The Governance Gate)

**Objective**: Maximum stability and zero-drift.
- **Rule 1**: No code changes without an approved BDD Spec in `02-Business-BDD/02-Behavior-Specs/`.
- **Rule 2**: Every fix must be audited against the spec before merging.
- **Rule 3**: Code cannot be merged until it strictly passes all Spec tests.
- **Primary Brains**: `02-Business-BDD`, `03-Tech-Stack`
- **AI Persona**: Unified **Systems Engineer** (applying QA, Architecture, and Development rules natively without roleplaying).
- **Best For**: Core libraries, financial logic, and stable infrastructure.

## 🚀 Mode 2: Free-Labs (The Fast Path)

**Objective**: Rapid prototyping and experimental flow.
- **Rule 1**: BDD Specs are optional. Focus on speed and "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product).
- **Rule 2**: Work is isolated in `04-Rapid-Prototyping/`. Experiments are logged in
  `01-Experiment-Index/` using the experiment template.
- **Rule 3**: After a "Labs" feature is validated, perform a "Graduation Ceremony" — creating the BDD spec in `02-Business-BDD` and transitioning the code to Mode 1 standards.
- **Primary Brain**: `04-Rapid-Prototyping`
- **AI Persona**: Unified **Systems Engineer** (focused on fast-track development and rapid iteration).
- **Best For**: UI/UX design, new trading strategies, and one-off 20-Scripts.

---

## 🛰️ Mode 3: Agent Orchestrator (The Fleet Commander)

**Objective**: Scale and mass-execution.
- **Rule 1**: AI operates across multiple repositories simultaneously.
- **Rule 2**: Focus on "Fleet-Wide Action Plans" in
  `05-Fleet-Operation/01-Fleet-Action-Plans/` rather than individual lines of code.
- **Rule 3**: Automated testing is mandatory for every repo in the action plan.
- **Primary Brain**: `05-Fleet-Operation`
- **AI Persona**: Unified **Systems Engineer** (focused on global architecture, synchronization, and ecosystem integrity).
- **Best For**: Global refactors, dependency updates, and release cycles.

---

## 🥷 Mode 4: Direct-Action (The Bypass)

**Objective**: Sporadic tasks and direct agent interaction without state overhead.
- **Rule 1**: Stateless execution. The global `active_mode` remains unchanged.
- **Rule 2**: No mandatory BDD or Sandbox tests (unless part of a specific sub-task).
- **Rule 3**: Best used for "Question & Answer" sessions, small script repairs, or one-off audits.
- **AI Persona**: Unified **Systems Engineer** (Default constraints).
- **Best For**: Quick README updates, link repairs in the vault, or "asking one agent a question."

## 🚦 The Switching Protocol

To switch modes, the USER must:
1. Say: `"Switch to Mode X"` (where X is 1, 2, or 3).
2. The AI will update `active_mode` in the YAML header of this file.
3. The AI will update `AI-Session-State.md` with: `Active Protocol: [[MODE-MANUAL#Mode-X]]`.
4. The AI will announce:
   - Which **rules are activated** for this mode (e.g., Unified Systems Engineer).
   - Which **brains are primary** for this mode.
   - Which **constraints are relaxed or enforced**.

**Note on Mode 4**: This mode is typically activated via the `start_squad.py` CLI and does not require a global state change.
