# Project Context Map

This file links the agnostic `00-AI-Engine` to the specific project it is currently embedded in.

When an AI Agent is instantiated, it MUST read the YAML frontmatter of this file to understand:
1. The `ecosystem_name` it is working on.
2. The paths to the critical rule documents.
